# Hanum
An OpenStreetMap attributes linter with custom presets.

## Demo
Assume we have OSM attributes in JSON like this.
Saved as `sample.json`.
```json
{
  "version": 0.6,
  "generator": "Overpass API",
  "osm3s": {
    "timestamp_osm_base": "2016-12-11T04:06:02Z",
    "copyright": "The data included in this document is from www.openstreetmap.org. The data is made available under ODbL."
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "way",
      "id": 400611312,
      "nodes": [
        4031547479,
        4031547481,
        4031547475,
        4031547474,
        4031547464,
        4031547458,
        4031547456,
        4031547452,
        4031547455,
        4031547453,
        4031547448,
        4031547445,
        4031547450,
        4031547457,
        4031547460,
        4031547469,
        4031547463,
        4031547467,
        4031547472,
        4031547477,
        4031547470,
        4031547473,
        4031547476,
        4031547483,
        4031547478,
        4031547480,
        4031547482,
        4031547488,
        4031547484,
        4031547489,
        4031547479
      ],
      "tags": {
        "admin_level": "6",
        "building": "yes",
        "name": "Kantor Kecamatan Bintang Ara",
        "office": "government",
        "short_name": "Kantor Camat Bintang Ara",
        "wikipedia": "id:Bintang_Ara,_Tabalong"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The presets is `sample.presets.json` below.
```json
{
  "presets": {
    "short_name": "dontSameWith name",
    "address": "required"
  }
}

```

So, we now can lint it.

```
$ hanum sample.json sample.presets.json
[ERROR] Required key: address
```

**Explanation**: Since there is didn't exist attribute "address",
linter give an error message with `exit code 1`.
Attribute "short_name" passed because it's not same with "name".

```
$ hanum sample.json
[ERROR] Default presets currently didn't available!
```

Since currently we are didn't have any default presets, we can't lint it.

## Test it Out
This library written in Haskell with The Haskell Tool Stack.
Below is an installation and demo for the UNIX-like operating system.

Make sure you have [Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) installed on your system before running these commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wisn/hanum.git
$ cd hanum
$ stack install
$ hanum version
Hanum 0.0.1-alpha
$ cd sample
$ hanum sample.json sample.presets.json
```

**NOTE**: Currently the linter have a problem with the "presets" directory.
It's must be in the same directory. We can't do `hanum sample.json another/dir/presets.json`.
