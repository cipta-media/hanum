# Hanum
An OpenStreetMap attributes linter with custom presets.

## Requirements
We need [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) to run this program.
As a suggestion, use
[The Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
instead of Haskell Platform.

## Installation
For now, this program only support a manual installation.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wisn/hanum.git
$ cd hanum
$ stack install
$ hanum --version
Hanum CLI v0.1.0.0-alpha under the MIT License
Report any problem to https://github.com/wisn/hanum/issues
```

## Development Status
Rewrite the application. Work in progress.

## TODO
- [x] Arguments parser with their own data structure
- [ ] Presets parser with their own data structure
- [ ] ...
